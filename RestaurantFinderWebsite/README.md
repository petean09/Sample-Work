# Description

This website aims to create a friendly environment for users to look up quality restaurants based on location. The Google Map API is used to display a map and determine location (latitude and longitude coordinates) of the place specified by the user. This application uses the Yelp API to gather restaurants with top ratings based on the coornidates found. The Open Weather Map API creates an element that tells the user the weather at the specified location and proceeds with a personal message regarding the weather at that time.
