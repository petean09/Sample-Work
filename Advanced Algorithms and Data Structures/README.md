This is a sample of my work from CS330 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures. 

What I learned:
- Employ top-down/object-oriented design to solve complex problems.
- Use recursion to solve interesting problems like AVL Tree implementations.
- Determine the computational complexity of sorting and searching algorithms.
- Recognize and implement several abstract data types including a AVL trees, Heaps, and B-Trees. 
- Use abstract data types to solve programming problems.
- Determine the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing its computational complexity.
- Implement several advanced data structures and algorithms.
- Gain an understanding of recursion.
- Learn to use exception handling effectively
- Learn to use a debugger effectively
