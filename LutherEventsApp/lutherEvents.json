We will present some of the key benefits of using eportfolios with students, and we will introduce the technical aspects of using Google Sites. We will provide a few examples of eportfolios created using this platform, and we will give time for hands-on work in Google Sites.",

          "SUMMARY": "2019 Martin Luther King Jr. Day Commemoration: Roger Pulliam, \"A Fifty-Year Retrospective on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Impact on African American Students' Presence in Higher Education\"",
          "DESCRIPTION": "After the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., black college students across the United States reacted with sit-ins and demands that their campuses recruit more African American students, hire more faculty and administrators of color, and implement a diverse curriculum. Roger Pulliam was at Western Michigan University in 1968 when a group of students known as the Black Action Movement submitted a list of demands to WMU’s president challenging discriminatory practices at the school and demanding an increase in racial minority student and faculty representation on campus. That movement gave rise to what eventually became WMU’s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Scholars Academy. Having worked as a faculty member and administrator at predominantly white campuses for over 50 years, Pulliam will share insights regarding how King’s philosophy and vision empowered black students to engage in one of the most transformative educational movements in U.S. history. He will also explore how King’s philosophy and vision speak to today’s racial realities at colleges and universities across the U.S.\\nFor 30 years, Roger Pulliam was professor of curriculum and instruction in the College of Education at the University of Wisconsin– Whitewater, from which he retired as emeritus assistant vice chancellor for Academic Support Services. He has written extensively about black student unions and is senior faculty advisor of the Office of National Black Student Union.",

          "DESCRIPTION": "Shahira Amin is a Cairo-based independent journalist writing for Al Monitor, Index on Censorship, and Freemuse. She started her career as a broadcaster and was Deputy Head of state-run Nile TV when she resigned in February 2011 to protest censorship of her work. A longtime contributor to CNN's Inside Africa, Amin has filed numerous feature stories from the North Africa region on sectarian conflicts, the rights of women and minorities, gender-based violence, and the developments in her region. She is a founder-member of the Egyptian Media Women Union, a Cairo-based non governmental organization that acts as a support network for women journalists, extending moral, legal, and professional support to female journalists in the provinces outside Cairo. Amin is also former board member of the International Women's Forum, a Washington-based NGO that brings together women leaders from 44 countries. Amin has won several awards for her work, including Sweden's Holmes Award 2011, Spain's Julio Anguita Parrado Award 2012 for courageous journalism, The Global Thinkers Forum Excellence in Promoting Gender Equity Award 2014, the American University in Cairo's Catalyst for Change Award 2012, and the BMW Foundation's Responsible Leader Award 2016.",

          "DESCRIPTION": "In 1968, the Northern California State Choir recorded the album Let Us Go into the House of the Lord with plans to sell 500 copies at local churches. However, the cut “O Happy Day,” an arrangement of the 18th century hymn, gained such popularity that it was released internationally in 1969; with sales of over seven million copies, it remains the biggest-selling gospel single in history.\\nWhile many know the name of choir director/arranger Edwin Hawkins, few know that several female artists contributed to, built upon, or were inspired by the song. This lecture’s focus will be on such significant performers as: the original lead singer, Dorothy Combs Morrison, whose vocal range and quality as well as her lyrical additions were a major part of the song’s success; Tramaine Hawkins, a member of the choir in 1968, who became one of the most iconic gospel singers of the last half century; and Vickie Mack Lataillade who was so captivated by Hawkins’ contemporary gospel sound that she founded Gospo Centric Records and signed such chart-topping artists as Kirk Franklin and\\nTrin-I-Tee 5:7.  Other women whose careers are connected to this song in some way include folk singer/activist Joan Baez, gospel legend Dorothy Norwood, and international Evangelist Gwendolyn Reid.\\nThis presentation will examine the extent to which these women expanded the popularity of the song and helped to challenge the prevailing boundaries regarding who can perform gospel music and where it can be performed as well as how one should look and sound while doing so.",

In August 2016, her book \"Fertility Holidays: IVF Tourism and the Reproduction of Whiteness\" was released by NYU Press. This research is based on multi-sited, multi-year ethnographic project with North Americans who travel to Czech Republic for assisted reproductive technologies. Speier traces North American fertility journeys to Czech Republic, examining the multiple motivations that compel them to travel halfway across the globe in their quest for parenthood. Speier's current research is an examination of couples from all over the world who travel to North America seeking fertility treatment.",
